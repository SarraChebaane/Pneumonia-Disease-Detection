# Pneumonia-Disease-Detection
Pneumonia is a serious respiratory illness that affects millions of people every year, and early detection is crucial for successful treatment.
In this project, we aim to develop a deep learning model for detecting pneumonia from X-ray images. The model leverages the power of convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
and the ResNet architecture to analyze X-ray images and accurately identify the presence of pneumonia. By using a combination of these advanced techniques, 
we hope to improve the speed and accuracy of pneumonia detection, helping medical professionals diagnose and treat the disease more effectively.
For this project i used a dataset from kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/code/hossamgalal68/chest-x-ray-pneumonia-with-cnn/data
